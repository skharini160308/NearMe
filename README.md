     </body>
     There isn't a famous "Corner House" in Krishnagiri itself, but rather the well-known Corner House Ice Cream chain, famous for desserts like Death by Chocolate, originated in Bangalore and has locations in nearby Chennai, suggesting its popularity extends to the region; Krishnagiri is known for mangoes and history, so perhaps a local corner house exists, but the brand is Bangalore-based.
